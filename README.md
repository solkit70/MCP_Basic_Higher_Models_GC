# MCP Basic & Higher Models (GC)

This repository contains my hands-on learning for Model Context Protocol (MCP) following the roadmap documented in `GC_version/GC_docs/250921_roadmap_githubcopilot.md`.

Goals:
- Practice MCP by building small labs and examples.
- Track progress and notes alongside the roadmap.

Structure:
- `GC_version/GC_docs/` – Roadmap and study notes.
- `labs/` – Practical exercises (to be created): Node/TypeScript MCP servers, Python experiments, and client integrations.

Getting Started:
1) Read the roadmap: `GC_version/GC_docs/250921_roadmap_githubcopilot.md`.
2) Set up prerequisites: Git, Node.js LTS, Python (optional).
3) Follow the labs in the `labs/` folder as they are added.

Conventions:
- Branch name: `main`.
- Commit style: small, focused commits with clear messages.
- Use Issues/Projects on GitHub to track tasks.

License: TBD.
